200 Birds classification


keep working ... 
Everything is based on the script Google provide:
http://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-iot-edge-pretrained-models/docker/classify_scripts.tgz
and
https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git

Please replace related files in docker /research/slim and /research/slim/dataset
I cp some files and end at _birds.sh or _birds.py for easy reading and managements. But, dataset_factory.py in slim/dataset, I keep the original name because other python script need it.
